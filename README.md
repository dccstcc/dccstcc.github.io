            <p style="text-indent: 4%">This document contain all phases of construct my own idea for realise engineering project for Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. <span style="text-indent: 4%"> I constructed embedded system with hardware prototype for motorcycles drivers. </span> <span style="text-indent: 4%"> This project base on Android mobile application connected with Raspberry Pi IoT board which maintain laser distance measuring sensor. On the smartphone screen we can observe real-time graphics simulation of vehicle ride. On screen during drive the motorcycle we can see actual distace between motorcycle and following car and actual speed of ride. When speed is to high according to keep distance between vehicles the system inform us on the screen that it is impossible to suddenly stop the car with aviod the crash and suggest us safe speed of ride in actual traffic configuration.</span></p>

            <p style="text-indent: 4%">This solution contains Angular SPA for register new users in system as frontend of application. After add new user new data are send for REST API backend endpoint. Backend work on .NET framework implementation. After register new user it is possible to read new user data in web browser.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 4%">In this project I wrote software for Arduino IDE in C++ language fork and deploy this software in Arduino board memory. After that I connected Arduino board with hardware prototype contains LED diodes, resistors, display and button. This built scheme is simulation of game cube which player can throw by press button. Random result of throw is possible to observe on the LED diodes and sum of results appear on the display.

        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p style="text-indent: 4%">I am interested in wide range programming. I can tell that it is my passion. </p> 
        <p style="text-indent: 4%"> The same i can repeat about global IT field and similiar branches like electronics, mechatronics, robotics, automatics also mechanics. </p> 
        <p style="text-indent: 4%"> Apart from engineering topics I'm familiar with geography, biology, physics and chemistry. In addition I like new tech in medicine and automotive. </p> 
        <p style="text-indent: 4%"> I like lectures which describe: how new tech like IT can improve and help another sectors or branches ? </p>
  
        <p style="text-indent: 4%">During my studies, I was involved in additional training on various topics, such as:
